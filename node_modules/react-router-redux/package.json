[React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) is cool. The problem is that react-router manages an important piece of your application state: the URL. If you are using redux, you want your app state to fully represent your UI; if you snapshotted the app state, you should be able to load it up later and see the same thing.\n\nreact-router does a great job of mapping the current URL to a component tree, and continually does so with any URL changes. This is very useful, but we really want to store this state in redux as well.\n\nThe entire state that we are interested in boils down to one thing: the URL. This is an extremely simple library that just puts the URL in redux state and keeps it in sync with any react-router changes. Additionally, you can change the URL via redux and react-router will change accordingly.\n\n```\nnpm install react-router-redux\n```\n\nIf you want to install the next major version, use `react-router-redux@next`. Run `npm dist-tag ls react-router-redux` to see what `next` is aliased to.\n\nView the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.\n\nRead the [API docs](#api) farther down this page.\n\n##### _What about redux-router?_\n\n[redux-router](https://github.com/rackt/redux-router) is another project which solves the same problem. However, it's far more complex. Take a quick look at [the code for this library](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux/blob/master/src/index.js)â€”it's extremely minimal. redux-router is much bigger and more complex.\n\nThat said, redux-router is a fine project and has features this doesn't provide. Use it if you like it better.\n\n**Compared with redux-router:**\n\n* Much smaller and simpler. You don't need to learn another library on top of everything else.\n* We encourage direct access of react-router APIs. Need server-side rendering, or something else advanced? Just read react-router's docs.\n* We only put the current location in state, whereas redux-router stores the entire router state, which includes router-specific things like params.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe idea of this library is to use react-router's functionality exactly like its documentation tells you to. You can access all of its APIs in routing components. Additionally, you can use redux like you normally would, with a single app state.\n\n[redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) (`store.routing`) &nbsp;&harr;&nbsp; [**react-router-redux**](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux) &nbsp;&harr;&nbsp; [history](https://github.com/rackt/history) (`history.location`) &nbsp;&harr;&nbsp; [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)\n\nWe only store current URL and state, whereas redux-router stores the entire location object from react-router. You can read it, and also change it with an action.\n\n### Tutorial\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example.\n\n**Note:** This example uses `react-router`'s 2.0 API, which is currently released under version 2.0.0-rc5.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\nimport { Router, Route, browserHistory } from 'react-router'\nimport { syncHistory, routeReducer } from 'react-router-redux'\nimport reducers from '<project-path>/reducers'\n\nconst reducer = combineReducers(Object.assign({}, reducers, {\n  routing: routeReducer\n}))\n\n// Sync dispatched route actions to the history\nconst reduxRouterMiddleware = syncHistory(browserHistory)\nconst createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(reduxRouterMiddleware)(createStore)\n\nconst store = createStoreWithMiddleware(reducer)\n\n// Required for replaying actions from devtools to work\nreduxRouterMiddleware.listenForReplays(store)\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Provider store={store}>\n    <Router history={browserHistory}>\n      <Route path=\"/\" component={App}>\n        <Route path=\"foo\" component={Foo}/>\n        <Route path=\"bar\" component={Bar}/>\n      </Route>\n    </Router>\n  </Provider>,\n  document.getElementById('mount')\n)\n```\n\nNow you can read from `state.routing.location.pathname` to get the URL. It's far more likely that you want to change the URL more often, however. You can use the `push` action creator that we provide:\n\n```js\nimport { routeActions } from 'react-router-redux'\n\nfunction MyComponent({ dispatch }) {\n  return <Button onClick={() => dispatch(routeActions.push('/foo'))}/>;\n}\n```\n\nThis will change the state, which will trigger a change in react-router. Additionally, if you want to respond to the path update action, just handle the `UPDATE_LOCATION` constant that we provide:\n\n```js\nimport { UPDATE_LOCATION } from 'react-router-redux'\n\nfunction update(state, action) {\n  switch(action.type) {\n  case UPDATE_LOCATION:\n    // do something here\n  }\n}\n```\n**But how do I access router props in a Container component?**\n\nreact-router [injects route information via a child component's props](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/latest/docs/Introduction.md#getting-url-parameters). This makes accessing them from a simple component easy. When using a react-redux Container to connect simple components to the store state and dispatch you can access these injected route information from the [2nd argument of `mapStateToProps`](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) as follows:\n\n```js\nfunction mapStateToProps(state, ownProps) {\n  return {\n    id: ownProps.params.id,\n    filter: ownProps.location.query.filter\n  };\n}\n```\n\n\n### Examples\n\n* [examples/basic](https://github.com/rackt/react-router-redux/blob/master/examples/basic) - basic reference implementation\n\nExamples from the community:\n\n* [davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) - popular redux starter kit\n  * **tip**: migrating from redux-router? use [this commit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/commit/db66626ca8a02ecf030a3f7f5a669ac338fd5897) as a reference\n* [freeqaz/redux-simple-router-example](https://github.com/freeqaz/redux-simple-router-example) - example implementation\n* [choonkending/react-webpack-node](https://github.com/choonkending/react-webpack-node) - boilerplate for universal redux and react-router\n* [tj/frontend-boilerplate](https://github.com/tj/frontend-boilerplate)\n* [bdefore/universal-redux](https://github.com/bdefore/universal-redux) - npm package for universally rendered redux applications\n* [tomatau/breko-hub](https://github.com/tomatau/breko-hub) - Babel, React & Koa, Hot Universal Boilerplate - focused on developer experience.\n* [yangli1990/react-redux-isomorphic](https://github.com/yangli1990/Isomorphic-Universal-React-Template) - boilerplate for universal redux and redux-simple-router\n* [StevenIseki/redux-simple-router-example](https://github.com/StevenIseki/redux-simple-router-example)\n* [mattkrick/meatier](https://github.com/mattkrick/meatier) - SSR, dual dev/prod client builds\n* [mxstbr/react-boilerplate](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate/tree/v3.0.0) - :fire: Quick setup for performance orientated, offline first React.js applications\n  * **Tip**: Upgrading from react-router w/o react-router-redux?

Send us a PR!_\n\n### API\n\n#### `syncHistory(history: History) => ReduxMiddleware`\n\nCall this to create a middleware that can be applied with Redux's `applyMiddleware` to allow actions to call history methods. The middleware will look for route actions created by `push`, `replace`, etc. and applies them to the history.\n\n#### `ReduxMiddleware.listenForReplays(store: ReduxStore, selectLocationState?: function)`\n\nBy default, the syncing logic will not respond to replaying of actions, which means it won't work with projects like redux-devtools. Call this function on the middleware object returned from `syncHistory` and give it the store to listen to, and it will properly work with action replays. Obviously, you would do that after you have created the store and everything else has been set up.\n\nSupply an optional function `selectLocationState` to customize where to find the location state on your app state. It defaults to `state => state.routing.location`, so you would install the reducer under the name \"routing\". Feel free to change this to whatever you like.\n\n#### `ReduxMiddleware.unsubscribe()`\n\nCall this on the middleware returned from `syncHistory` to stop the syncing process set up by `listenForReplays`.\n\n#### `routeReducer`\n\nA reducer function that keeps track of the router state. You must add this reducer to your app reducers when creating the store. It will return a `location` property in state. If you use `combineReducers`, it will be nested under wherever property you add it to (`state.routing` in the example above).\n\n**Warning:** It is a bad pattern to use `react-redux`'s `connect` decorator to map the state from this reducer to props on your `Route` components. This can lead to infinite loops and performance problems. `react-router` already provides this for you via `this.props.location`.\n\n#### `UPDATE_LOCATION`\n\nAn action type that you can listen for in your reducers to be notified of route updates.\n\n#### `routeActions`\n\nAn object that contains all the actions creators you can use to manipulate history:\n\n* `push(nextLocation: LocationDescriptor)`\n* `replace(nextLocation: LocationDescriptor)`\n* `go(n: number)`\n* `goForward()`\n* `goBack()`\n\nA [location descriptor](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/Glossary.md#locationdescriptor) can be a descriptive object (see the link) or a normal URL string. The most common action is to push a new URL via `routeActions.push(...)`. These all directly call the analogous [history methods](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md#navigation).\n",
